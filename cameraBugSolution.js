The solution depends on the specific conflicting library.  Generally, these steps can help resolve the issue:

1. **Check Library Documentation:** Refer to the third-party library's documentation to understand how it interacts with the camera.  Look for any guidance on using it with other camera-related components.
2. **Asynchronous Operations:** Ensure that any operations involving the camera, especially within the third-party library and Expo's `Camera` component, are handled asynchronously using Promises or async/await. This helps avoid race conditions.
3. **Lifecycle Management:** Pay close attention to the component lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`).  Release camera resources properly when the component is unmounted to prevent conflicts.
4. **Permissions:** Double-check that camera permissions are handled correctly and that no conflicting permission requests exist.
5. **Context Management:** If possible, consider refactoring code to centralize camera access and control through a dedicated context or service.  This can help prevent interference between different parts of the application.
6. **Alternative Libraries:** Explore alternative third-party libraries that may have better compatibility with Expo's `Camera` component.

**Example (Illustrative - adapt to your specific situation):**

```javascript
//cameraBugSolution.js
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const MyCamera = () => {
  const cameraRef = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    // Request camera permissions
    // ...
    return () => {
      // Release camera resources
      if (cameraRef.current) {
        cameraRef.current.stopRecording(); // Or other relevant cleanup actions
      }
    };
  }, []);
  return (
    <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} ref={cameraRef} />
  );
};
export default MyCamera;
```
