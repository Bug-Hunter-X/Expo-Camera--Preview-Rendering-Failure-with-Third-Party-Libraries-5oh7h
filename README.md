# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Expo's Camera API with a third-party library that also interacts with the device's camera.  The issue results in the camera preview failing to render, potentially leading to a blank screen or app crash.

The `cameraBug.js` file showcases the problematic code integrating the Expo Camera component with a hypothetical conflicting library.  The `cameraBugSolution.js` offers a solution to resolve this conflict, ensuring proper camera preview rendering. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or a similar Expo client.
4. Observe the camera preview's behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the camera context and resource allocation, ensuring there are no conflicting requests or improper handling of the camera's lifecycle.
