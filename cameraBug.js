This error occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component in conjunction with certain third-party libraries or custom components.  The error message might not be explicit but manifests as the camera preview failing to render, showing a blank screen, or crashing the app.  The root cause is often a conflict in how these components handle the underlying camera permissions and resources.  For example, using a library that also requests camera access or manipulates the camera context might interfere with Expo's `Camera` component leading to unexpected behavior.
